   ```

## 🛠️ **Advanced Troubleshooting**

### **Check Network Configuration**

```bash
# On host device
ipconfig /all  # Windows
ifconfig       # Mac/Linux

# Look for hotspot IP (usually 192.168.43.1)
```

### **Test Server Manually**

```bash
# Start server manually
cd Lan-mafia
node server/hostServer.js

# Should see:
# "LAN Mafia server running on port 3000"
# "Local IP: 192.168.43.1"
```

### **Check Firewall Settings**

- Windows: Allow Node.js through firewall
- Android: Allow LAN Mafia app network access
