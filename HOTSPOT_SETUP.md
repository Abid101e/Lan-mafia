# ðŸ”¥ LAN Mafia Hotspot Setup Guide

## ðŸ“± **How Hotspot Works**

When someone creates a mobile hotspot, their phone becomes a WiFi router. Other devices connect to this hotspot, creating a local network where the host phone has IP `192.168.43.1`.

## ðŸŽ® **Setup Instructions**

### **HOST DEVICE (Creates Hotspot)**

1. **Turn on Mobile Hotspot**
   - Go to Settings â†’ Network & Internet â†’ Hotspot & Tethering
   - Turn on "Mobile Hotspot"
   - Set a password and share it with other players

2. **Start LAN Mafia**
   - Open the app
   - Enter your name
   - Tap "âš¡ INITIATE HOST"
   - The app will show IP: `192.168.43.1`

3. **Start Game Server**
   - Tap "INITIALIZE SERVER"
   - Wait for other players to connect
   - Tap "LAUNCH SIMULATION" when ready

### **PLAYER DEVICES (Connect to Hotspot)**

1. **Connect to Host's Hotspot**
   - Go to WiFi settings
   - Find host's hotspot name
   - Enter the password provided by host
   - Connect to the hotspot

2. **Join LAN Mafia**
   - Open the app
   - Enter your name
   - Tap "ðŸ”Œ CONNECT TO NETWORK"
   - Enter IP: `192.168.43.1`

## ðŸ”§ **Troubleshooting**

### **Connection Issues**
- **Host**: Make sure hotspot is ON and password is shared
- **Players**: Make sure you're connected to host's hotspot
- **IP Address**: Always use `192.168.43.1` for host
- **Firewall**: Allow connections on port 3000

### **Common Problems**
1. **"Connection Failed"**
   - Check if hotspot is active
   - Verify IP address is correct

2. **"Server Not Found"**
